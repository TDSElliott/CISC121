Algorithm Design:

1.  If list is empty, return list

2.  Loop through the list, check if the current 'data' value
    is the same as the following 'data' value

3.  If it is the same, connect the 'next' of the current node,
    to the 'next' of the following node

4.  Loop again to check if the new following 'data' is the same
    value as the current 'data' value
