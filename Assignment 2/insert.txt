Algorithm Design:

Cases:
1.  If the linked list is empty, make the node the head
    and return it
2.  If the value to be inserted is < the head node,
    insert the node at the start as the head
3.  Loop until you reach a node with a value
    greater than the value to be inserted. The node just before
    this greater value is what should be connected
4.  Insert the node after the appropriate node found previous,
    linking back up the end of the linked list
